    "In this tutorial, you will learn how to create and run MLOps pipelines integrated with CI/CD. This tutorial goes through an example pipeline that is defined two ways: first using a custom python syntax, and second using Kubeflow syntax (either option is valid, whichever is preferred is up to you). The example pipeline builds and deploys a classification model; the pipeline go through a very basic workflow:\n",
    "1. create_dataset: A custom component that will export the dataset from BQ to GCS as a csv.\n",
    "2. train_model: A custom component that will train a decision tree classifier on the training data.\n",

    "2. Do not reference functions or variables from another cell within the scope of a custom component.\n",
    "3. Test each of your components for accuracy and correctness before running them using AutoMLOps. We cannot fix bugs automatically; bugs are much more difficult to fix once they are made into pipelines.\n",
    "4. If you are using Kubeflow, be sure to define all the requirements needed to run the custom component - it can be easy to leave out packages which will cause the container to fail when running within a pipeline. \n"
