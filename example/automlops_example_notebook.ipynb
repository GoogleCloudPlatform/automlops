This tutorial goes through an example pipeline that is defined two ways: first using a custom python syntax, and second using Kubeflow syntax (either option is valid, whichever is preferred is up to you). The example pipeline builds and deploys a classification model; the pipeline go through a very basic workflow:\n",

    "2. Import statements and helper functions must be added inside the function. Provide parameter type hints.\n",
    "3. Test each of your components for accuracy and correctness before running them using AutoMLOps. We cannot fix bugs automatically; bugs are much more difficult to fix once they are made into pipelines.\n",
    "4. If you are using Kubeflow, be sure to define all the requirements needed to run the custom component - it can be easy to leave out packages which will cause the container to fail when running within a pipeline. \n"
