    "# Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial explores using AutoMLOps for model monitoring on a pre-trained customer churn model. The tutorial will walk you through how to use AutoMLOps to define, create and run inference pipelines, and create a model monitoring job around a Vertex AI Endpoint.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Model Monitoring?\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern applications rely on a well established set of capabilities to monitor the health of their services. Examples include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* software versioning\n",
    "* rigorous deployment processes\n",
    "* event logging\n",
    "* alerting/notication of situations requiring intervention\n",
    "* on-demand and automated diagnostic tracing\n",
    "* automated performance and functional testing\n",
    "\n",
    "You should be able to manage your ML services with the same degree of power and flexibility with which you can manage your applications. That's what MLOps is all about - managing ML services with the best practices Google and the broader computing industry have learned from generations of experience deploying well engineered, reliable, and scalable services.\n",
    "\n",
    "Model monitoring is only one piece of the MLOps puzzle - it helps answer the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* How well do recent service requests match the training data used to build your model? This is called **training-serving skew**.\n",
    "* How significantly are service requests evolving over time? This is called **drift detection**.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Vertex Explainable AI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/explainable-ai/overview) adds another facet to model monitoring, which we call feature attribution monitoring. Explainable AI enables you to understand the relative contribution of each feature to a resulting prediction. In essence, it assesses the magnitude of each feature's influence.\n",
    "\n",
    "If production traffic differs from  training data, or varies substantially over time, **either in terms of model predictions or feature attributions**, that's likely to impact the quality of the answers your model produces. When that happens, you'd like to be alerted automatically and responsively, so that **you can anticipate problems before they affect your customer experiences or your revenue streams**.\n",

    "### Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you learn to use the `Vertex AI Model Monitoring` service to detect drift and anomalies in prediction requests from a deployed `Vertex AI Model` resource. You will then learn how to create and run MLOps pipelines integrated with CI/CD. The pipeline goes through the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. deploy_and_test_model: Upload a pretrained model and deploy it to an Endpoint. Runs tests for predictions and explainability. \n",
    "2. create_monitoring_job: Creates a model monitoring job and sends alerts to specified emails. \n",
    "3. test_monitoring_job: Generate synthetic prediction requests and analyze monitoring. \n",
    "\n",
    "# Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to use AutoMLOps, the following are required:\n",

    "# Ground-rules for using AutoMLOps\n",
    "1. Do not use variables, functions, code, etc. not defined within the scope of a custom component. These custom components will become containers and will have no reference to the out of scope code.\n",
    "2. Import statements and helper functions must be added inside the function. Provide parameter type hints.\n",
    "3. Test each of your components for accuracy and correctness before running them using AutoMLOps. We cannot fix bugs automatically; bugs are much more difficult to fix once they are made into pipelines.\n",
    "4. If you are using Kubeflow, be sure to define all the requirements needed to run the custom component - it can be easy to leave out packages which will cause the container to fail when running within a pipeline.  \n"

    "This tutorial uses a pre-trained model, where the model artifacts are stored in a public Cloud Storage bucket. The model predicts for an online gaming site, the probability that a player may churn, i.e. stop being an active player.\n",

    "The model you use in this notebook is based on [this blog post](https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/developers-practitioners/churn-prediction-game-developers-using-google-analytics-4-ga4-and-bigquery-ml). The idea behind this model is that your company has extensive log data describing how your game users have interacted with the site. The raw data contains the following categories of information:\n",
    "\n",
    "- identity - unique player identitity numbers\n",
    "- demographic features - information about the player, such as the geographic region in which a player is located\n",
    "- behavioral features - counts of the number of times a  player has triggered certain game events, such as reaching a new level\n",
    "- churn propensity - this is the label or target feature, it provides an estimated probability that this player will churn, i.e. stop being an active player.\n",
    "\n",
    "The blog article referenced above explains how to use BigQuery to store the raw data, pre-process the data for machine learning, and train the corresponding model.
