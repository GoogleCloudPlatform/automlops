# Terraform templates

In our current development setup, we have adopted a dynamic and flexible configuration management strategy by leveraging the power of Jinja2 templating engine and Terraform's Infrastructure as Code (IaC) capabilities. This enables us to generate highly customizable and adaptive infrastructure configurations based on our specific needs and conditions.
