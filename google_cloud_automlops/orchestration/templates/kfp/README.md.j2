# AutoMLOps - Generated Code Directory

**Note: This directory contains code generated using AutoMLOps**

AutoMLOps is a service that generates a production ready MLOps pipeline from Jupyter Notebooks, bridging the gap between Data Science and DevOps and accelerating the adoption and use of Vertex AI. The service generates an MLOps codebase for users to customize, and provides a way to build and manage a CI/CD integrated MLOps pipeline from the notebook. AutoMLOps automatically builds a source repo for versioning, cloudbuild configs and triggers, an artifact registry for storing custom components, gs buckets, service accounts and updated IAM privs for running pipelines, enables APIs (cloud Run, Cloud Build, Artifact Registry, etc.), creates a runner service API in Cloud Run for submitting PipelineJobs to Vertex AI, and a Cloud Scheduler job for submitting PipelineJobs on a recurring basis. These automatic integrations empower data scientists to take their experiments to production more quickly, allowing them to focus on what they do best: providing actionable insights through data.
