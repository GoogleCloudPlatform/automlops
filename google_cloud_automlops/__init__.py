AutoMLOps

AutoMLOps is a service that generates a production-style MLOps pipeline
from Jupyter Notebooks. The tool currently operates as a local package
import, with the end goal of becoming a Jupyter plugin to Vertex
Workbench managed notebooks. The tool will generate yaml-component
definitions, complete with Dockerfiles and requirements.txts for all
Kubeflow components defined in a notebook. It will also generate a
series of directories to support the creation of Vertex Pipelines.
